/**
 * Ken Thompson's algorithm, adapted for the VM implementation. Because we don't
 * have backtracking, we know we only need to process each character once.
 * Rather than backtracking, we check all the possibilities for the current
 * character. Any that pass get progressed and will be checked for the next
 * char. If they don't pass, they're just discarded. If we introduce a split,
 * we add both to the current to-process list, and both get checked against the
 * current char.
 *
 * Thereâ€™s a comment about this VM, which turned into the Pike VM when we added
 * submatching, not respecting thread priority. I don't have a test for it. It's
 * something to do with the instructions that add more instructions to the clist
 * only adding them one at a time, so other instructions can run first and put
 * other instructions in front of them that shouldn't be first. I get that, but
 * I'm not sure how to test it.
